Members came together, united by their love for competition and camaraderie. The clan showed promise, building a foundation that would later become crucial to our survival.</p>

                        <p>Unfortunately, internal challenges arose that tested our resolve. The clan master became inactive, and without leadership, the structure began to crumble. Activity declined, and the community that once thrived faced an uncertain future. It was a difficult time, but it taught us valuable lessons about leadership and commitment.</p>
